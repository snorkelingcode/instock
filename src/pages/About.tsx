              TCG Updates began in early 2024 during a period of unprecedented growth in the trading card game market. As lifelong TCG enthusiasts ourselves, we recognized the need for a comprehensive platform that went beyond just tracking inventory.

              What started as a simple product tracker quickly evolved into a hub for news, market trends, and DIY projects. Our community has grown through word of mouth as collectors, players, and hobbyists share their success stories of finding products, staying informed, and creating unique accessories for their collections.
